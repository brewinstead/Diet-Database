# Diet-Database
Senior Research Project
My Senior Research Project will be to create a diet database that will allow users to enter their personal information (gender, age, weight, height, BMI, blood type, diseases, allergies, etc) and recieve a dietary plan based off of the information input that will help ensure a healthier lifestyle and maintain a weight loss resulting in a happier and longer life.
